# testgit

test git

commited in gitkracken, and modified in gitkracken

This did not seem to work until I pushed. Merely fast forwarding did not work???

This needs to be staged and committed before it appears in Github/origin.

When they are staged, I can see them as uncommited changes. 

Working now in VS

will commit in VS using source control

forgot to stage one change

added commit template
